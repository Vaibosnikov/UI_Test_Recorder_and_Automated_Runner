#  TestCraft – UI Test Recorder & Automated Runner

> **TestCraft** is an open-source, browser-based automation framework that lets testers and developers record user interactions, convert them into runnable Playwright scripts, and visualize test execution insights via an integrated dashboard.

---

##  Overview

TestCraft bridges the gap between **manual testing** and **automation** by offering a **record-and-replay** workflow for browser-based UI testing.  
It empowers non-engineers and QA teams to automate without deep coding skills, providing a modern interface to record interactions, generate Playwright specs, execute them, and analyze the results with visual reports and trends.

## Key Features

- 🎥 **Browser Recorder:** Capture clicks, text inputs, and navigations in real-time.  
- 🧩 **Script Generation:** Export clean, runnable Playwright test specs with assertions.  
- ⚡ **Automated Runner:** Execute tests locally or via CI/CD pipelines.  
- 📊 **Dashboard Interface:** View pass/fail status, screenshots, logs, and trends.  
- 🖼️ **Visual Regression:** Compare baseline vs current screenshots with pixel-level diffs.  
- 🛠️ **CI/CD Integration:** Ready-to-use GitHub Actions template for continuous testing.
