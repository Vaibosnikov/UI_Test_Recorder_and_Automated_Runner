This document describes the role of the Automation Engineer in the TestCraft project, the core responsibilities, and the tools/technologies used.
The main goal is to make software testing happen automatically — so people don’t have to test everything by hand.

Creating a Chrome Extension using **Manifest V3** and **JavaScript** that records everything a user does on a website — like clicking buttons, typing text, or opening pages.
Converting these recorded actions into **Playwright** test scripts written in **TypeScript**, so they can replay the same steps and check if the website still works properly.
Adding small tests, called **assertions**, to confirm if everything works as expected — for example, checking if a button appears or a message displays correctly.
Connecting all these tests to **CI/CD pipelines** so they run automatically whenever new code is updated, helping to catch bugs early.
Using **Pixelmatch** to compare screenshots and detect any UI changes, and **Allure Reports** to show which tests passed or failed in a clean, detailed format.

To build tools that record, generate, and run automated tests — helping developers find issues faster and release better, more reliable software.
